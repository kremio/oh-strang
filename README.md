A linear algebra library written in C/C++ and compiled to JavaScript.

## The story
This is a  week-end project to consolidate what I've learned from Pr. Strang MIT lectures on linear algebra and getting down and directy with Emscripten.
I'm sure they are plenty of good libraries written in portable C/C++ or JavaScript for that purpose, but the point is to learn.

## Development Environment
The code is written in Eclipse Neon with the CDT plugin.
Native compilation is done with the CLANG LLVM-frontend, and JS compilation with the Emscripten tools.
